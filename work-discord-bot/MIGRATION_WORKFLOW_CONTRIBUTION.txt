Migration Workflow Implementation - Contribution Summary

I have implemented a comprehensive Supabase database migration workflow for the work-discord-bot project to improve schema management and deployment consistency. The key contributions are:

1. Added Supabase CLI as a development dependency to enable migration commands within the project.

2. Updated package.json to include npm scripts for:
   - Creating new migration files with descriptive names and timestamps.
   - Applying all pending migrations to the Supabase database.
   - Rolling back the last applied migration if needed.

3. Created an initial baseline migration SQL file (20240801_initial_schema.sql) in the supabase/migrations directory. This migration reflects the current production database schema, ensuring full retrocompatibility with existing data and schemas.

4. Added detailed documentation in README.md explaining:
   - How to install dependencies and set up the environment.
   - How to create, apply, and rollback migrations using the new scripts.
   - Best practices for managing migrations and synchronizing database state across environments.

This migration workflow enables automated, version-controlled, and safe schema changes, reducing manual intervention and potential errors during database updates.

Please refer to the README.md and the supabase/migrations directory for usage details and migration files.
